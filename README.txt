Thank you for your interest in our work.
 Unfortunately, we have found a mistake in the previous data processing steps leading to some duplicates 
in the positive and negative datasets. In essence, there are 24 such duplicates, 
so we delete them from the negative dataset. The final datasets that you should use for your model development should be: 
- train_AMP3268.fasta
- train_nonAMP_9777.fasta
